# Sensor-Layout
A web interface which allows the user to determine the position, type, and other properties of each sensor and IoT-gateways in a site.  this site creates a JSON file that describes the site layout. 

In this project, we address the following issues
1. The set of properties of the various sensors
2. Support hierarchical layout
3. The design of the layout metafile (JSON).
4. Connectivity between the sensors and the gateway/s
